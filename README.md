# Metropolis-Hastings Simulation Study 💻

This project explores the **Metropolis-Hastings (MH)** algorithm for sampling from probability distributions using Python. It was developed as part of a graduate course in *Statistical Inference* at Virginia Tech.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a powerful **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** method used to draw samples from complex distributions. In this project, we simulate:

- Sampling from **t-distribution** using:
  - A standard **normal proposal** (unconditional)
  - A **conditional normal proposal** (centered at the previous sample)
- Sampling from a **normal distribution** using a **t-distribution** proposal

For each case, we test various sample sizes and degrees of freedom to evaluate how well the algorithm captures the target distribution.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Metropolis-Hastings is foundational in:
- **Bayesian inference**
- **Generative models**
- **Probabilistic programming**
- **Machine learning research**

Understanding its behavior improves insight into convergence, posterior approximation, and sampling efficiency.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run a simulation (example):
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Run plotter.py for figures. Output figures will be saved to the `Figures/` folder.
